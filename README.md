# Penguin-Classification üêß
- Final Project for UCLA "Python with Applications I" (PIC 16A)
- This project was a group project, so in the Markdown cells of the project you can see which parts I wrote and which parts my partner did.
- Our assignment was to analyze the penguin data given to us (see palmer_penguins.csv) and create two different types of classification models. We decided to create a Logistic Regression Model and a Random Forest Classifier. We ended up getting a 93.97% accuracy with the Logistic Regression Model and a 97.59% accuracy with the Random Forest Classifier (see ‚ÄúScoring Models‚Äù Section).
